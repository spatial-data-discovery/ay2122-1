Overview
--------
The purpose of this project is for you to showcase spatial data on a public website (https://spatial-data-discovery.github.io). The task is to find (or create) spatial data that interests you; explain why it is interesting; describe what it is, where it came from, and any processes you used to create/modify it; and produce a visualization of the data that expresses your interest to others.

- must include at least one graphic (still or animated); (e.g., a PNG or MP4)
    - *Specifications:* max width = 910 pixels
- must include data (or link to data)
    - Please include a readme file that explains each part of your deliverables (e.g., what they are, what they do, where they came from)
- must include code used to create or process the dataset
    - *Specifications:* I should be able to reproduce your data given an input file or link to a (publicly accessible) dataset (or datasets) and your process document
- must include a summary for a general audience that explains the graphic, why it is important, how it was created, and what you learned along the way
    - Please keep a *process document*, similar to your *weekly report* that includes links to all datasets, sources, code examples, procedures, processes, analyses, etc. that you have tried and/or completed; you can use this to help you summarize your data section on your website page.
    - Please use the project_GITHUB-USERNAME.Rmd as a template for your final submission.

The assessment of the project is broken down into categories as described below.

* font-end (45%)
    - summary, visuals, methods, and attribution
* back-end (30%)
    - data files, scripts, reproducible process
* web site design and creativity (25%)

```

The remaining 25% is awarded based on the qualitative nature of the project and website.
These points may be applied to interesting visualizations (such as video), unique processing techniques (in your python script), or stylized web layout.

Please note that our website supports CSS and JS, if you are interested in adding any special elements or stylistic touches.
*Please contact your professor before implementing these.*

Make certain the page looks the way you want it to after it is rendered to HTML.
You can render individual pages on your end if you have R, rmarkdown, and pandoc installed (see resources on our class website).
Feel free to email your professor to pull the repository and render the website for you.

**Please refrain from running the build.R script on your end and staging, committing, and pushing the rendered outputs to our repository.**
