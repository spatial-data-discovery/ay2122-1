This directory contains the zipped raster files to be used in the ASCII to NetCDF conversion challenge.

These data have been processed (by Davis et al.) from their original format and resolution (Didan, 2015), having been upscaled from 0.05 degrees to 0.5 degrees and stored in ASCII raster format.
